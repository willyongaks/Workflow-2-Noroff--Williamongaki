# Workflow-2-Noroff--Williamongaki
# Workflow 2 Course Assignment

## Brief

Configure the project to use Jest with Babel. Lesson 2 of Module 2 contains instructions to do this.

The lesson also contains instructions on adding TypeScript support for Jest.

You will need to create and configure a package.json file and install all necessary dependencies.

Remember to add the appropriate entries to a `.gitignore` file.

Use Parcel as the bundler.
```
parcel index.html
```

## Question 1: Typescript 1

Start with the file `question-1/question-1.js` which you should rename to have a `.ts` extension.

- Create a User interface as per the instructions.
- Convert the `createUser` function to TypeScript and make use of the User interface as the return type.

## Question 2: TypeScript 2

Start with the file `question-2/question-2.js` which you should rename to have a `.ts` extension.

- Create an enum as per the instructions.
- Create an interface as per the instructions.
- Convert the `createGame` function to TypeScript, making sure to use the interface as the parameter type.

Note: The function doesn't return a value however you still need to set a return type for the function.

## Question 3: Jest tests

Create a test file with a .js extension and create tests for all of the functions in `question-3/question-3.js`. 

**Note:** Do not use TypeScript to write your tests for this question.

## Question 4: Shopping cart TS and Jest testing

This question is based on a Shopping Cart class. You will first add the TypeScript needed then test that all of the methods work. When you write your tests, make sure that you're creating a new cart each time.

**Note:** Make sure to use the items available in `items.js` in your tests.

Start with the file `question-4/question-4.js` which you should rename to have a `.ts` extension.

### TypeScript:

- Create an Item interface as per the instructions
- Add the correct parameter and return types

### Jest testing:

Create a test file and write the following tests.

**Note:** You will need to import the shopping cart items from `items.js` so you can use them in your tests.

Write the following tests. Make sure that you create a new cart in each test (`const cart = new ShoppingCart()`):

1. Test that you can add an item to the cart: Use the `addToCart` method to add a single item, then check that methods `getCostTotal`, `getNumberOfItems` and `getCart` are all returning the correct values.
2. Test that you can add an 2 separate items to the cart: Use the `addToCart` method to add all 2 items, then check that methods `getCostTotal`, `getNumberOfItems` and `getCart` are all returning the correct values.
3. Test that you can't add the same item 3 times. Check that `getCostTotal`, `getNumberOfItems` and `getCart` are all returning the correct values.
4. Test that you can add 2 separate items with `addToCart` and then remove a single item with `removeFromCart`. Check that `getCostTotal`, `getNumberOfItems` and `getCart` are all returning the correct items.

## Question 5: GraphQL and Lodash

Start with the file `question-5/question-5.js`.

Create a GraphQL API call that uses the end point `https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api` that returns a list of `posts`. You can see an example of getting the posts in the documentation: https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/#example-top

Use a lodash method to sort the posts in a descending order using the `id` value. Store this as a variable so you can reuse it in the next part.

Loop through the **first 10** results from the variable you created above. Generate HTML for these results into the `<ul>` with the id of `results-list`. You should generate a `<li>` for each item, and display the the `id` and `title` fields in this `<li>`.

Style the HTML using Sass.

You can write the answer for this question in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
